# Getting Rusty
---
*Following [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/rustaceans) that covers the basics of the Rust language.*

Modules included in the course (and my progress so far):
- [X] Project Basiscs / Hello World
- [X] Language Basics (variables, scalar types, operators, functions etc.)
- [X] Modules and Crates
- [ ] Data Types (arrays, vectors, slices, tuples, structs, enums, generics)
- [ ] Control Structures (if, match, pattern matching, for and while loops)
- [ ] Functions and Macros
- [ ] Traits
- [ ] Memory Management
- [ ] Error Handling
- [ ] Concurrency

Seperately, there are 3 projects that are included in this course, but they will be placed in different repos and will be accordingly linked when I get to them.

Cheers!
